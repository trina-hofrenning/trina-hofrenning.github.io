I am a M.S. student at Columbia University studying Biostatistics (Public Health Data Science). Prior to this, I lived in Minneapolis, MN for two years working as a Statistical Programmer at the Mayo Clinic after college. I received my B.A. in Economics and Mathematics (Applied Mathematics and Statistics) from Macalester College in 2021. At Macalester, I worked as a supplemental instructor in the Economics department and as a Machine Learning teaching assistant in the Math department. I continue to work remotely in my position at Mayo supporting the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging and various researchers on neuroimaging, plasma, genetics, and women's health studies.
